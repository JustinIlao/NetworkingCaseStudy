# Networking Case Study

Advanced Networking final project where I configured and subnetted a hierarchal network.

This project involved configuring several protocols(IPV4 & IPV6) such as VRFS, Vlans, OSPF, EIGRP, MP-BGP, DHCP, PBRS, Static Routes and NAT.

As a final task I researched and applied further security to the network. This included DHCP snooping, OSPF MD5 authentication, and TTL security.
